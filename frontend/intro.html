<h2>Introduction</h2>
Welcome to What Bikes Win, an experiment that hopes to bring fellow bikers together for healthy debate and ultimately some fun. The experiment simulates a virtual drag race between any real-life motorcycle based on real performance data. It attempts to reason with the mysterious nature of motorcycle performance without imperfections such as the rider, weather conditions, and so on.

<h2>Get started</h2>
Simply enter the make and models of the motorcycles you want to race.

You can also share your race with friends, comment, vote, and add to your garage so that others know what you ride when commenting.

<h2>How it works</h2>
The algorithm takes into account power, weight, and torque. It even tries to simulate gear changes - so you can expect surprises throughout a race. Real life speed, distance and time is not directly comparable to what you'll see on the screen, though it should be proportional (it may seem exaggerated).

<h2>Signing Up</h2>
You can sign up to keep track of your recent races, vote, comment and add to your garage. More features are being added.

<h2>Insight Tabs</h2>

<p><b>Head2heads:</b> This is a list of the most popular motorcycle pairs people searched. E.g if a Fireblade and R1 are at number 1, it means they have appeared within the most races together.</p>

<p><b>Recent races:</b> This is a list of the most recent races people have searched.</p>


<h2>Help & Development</h2>
Features and improvements are always being added. If you have any ideas, issues, or would like to get involved, please contact me at casparwylie@gmail.com.
